## PLEASE RUN get_data.py FIRST
Please run get_data.py first as this will call the api and create 
the csv files that will be used throughout this exercise. We do 
this to limit the amount of calls to the data provider to avoid 
spamming them with calls.

It will take several minutes to create the final csv

The load the csv file called start.csv in the Data folder to 
start the rest of the project.
