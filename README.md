## Please install the following packages
pip install openmeteo-requests  
pip install requests-cache retry-requests numpy pandas os

## PLEASE RUN get_data.py FIRST
Please run get_data.py first as this will call the api and create the 
csv files that will be used throughout this exercise, as well as create
the starting dataframe. We do this to limit the amount of calls to the 
data provider to avoid spamming them with calls.

The load the csv file called start.csv in the Data folder to start the 
rest of the project.
